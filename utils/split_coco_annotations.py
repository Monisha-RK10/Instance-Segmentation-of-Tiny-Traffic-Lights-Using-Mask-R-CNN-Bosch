# Step 2: COCO JSON Splitter Script
# Splits a single COCO annotation file (with all 100 images) into separate train.json and val.json.
# For each image: Checks if its file_name is in the train or val image folder. If yes, updates its ID (new_id), stores in image_id_map.
# For annotations: Keeps only annotations of the selected images. Updates their image_id using image_id_map and assigns new unique ann_id.
# For categories: Keeps the original categories as-is.
